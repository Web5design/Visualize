===Description===
A processing-based music visualization framework.  Visualize was made to allow people to VJ live with custom-made visuals written in Processing.  It current lives in two branches --

audio-reactive uses the Fourier_Analyzer class to abstract away the analysis portion, and outputting a new FFT spectrum every frame.  This spectrum gets passed to visualizers (written as separate classes), and each class visualizes the information in a different way.

The nonreactive branch utilizes visuals that are not sound reactive, which makes it run faster on smaller, less powerful computers.

For both branches, Visualize.pde is the main file that puts it all together (that you should run from within Processing).  This file manages switching between visualizers and the entire parameter space.

controllerMap.pde is the controller mapping.  This can be set to either use keyboard inputs or MIDI controllers to manipulate the parameters in your sketches.  By default, the keyboard mapping is:
--number keys turn a visualizer on/off
--left/right arrow change the gain on the audio channel
--up/down arrow key change the 'blur' on the visuals
