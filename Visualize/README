===Description===
This folder has all of the framework for Visualize.  

-Visualize.pde is the main file that puts it all together (that you should run from within Processing).
-controllerMap.pde is the controller mapping.  This can be set to either use keyboard inputs or MIDI controllers to manipulate the parameters in your sketches.
-FourierAnalyzer is a class that is meant to do most of the number-crunching for you with minimal thought.  It comes with several methods meant to easily allow you to change the Fourier transform parameters and audio source.
-The rest of the .pde files are Visualizers.
