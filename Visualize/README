===Description===
This folder has all of the framework for Visualize.  

-Visualize.pde is the main file that puts it all together (that you should run from within Processing).

-controllerMap.pde is the controller mapping.  This can be set to either use keyboard inputs or MIDI controllers to manipulate the parameters in your sketches.  By default, the keyboard mapping is:
--number keys turn a visualizer on/off
--left/right arrow change the gain on the audio channel
--up/down arrow key change the 'blur' on the visuals

-FourierAnalyzer is a class that is meant to do most of the number-crunching for you with minimal thought.  It comes with several methods meant to easily allow you to change the Fourier transform parameters and audio source.  Ideally you don't have to mess with this.

-The rest of the .pde files are Visualizers.  Write your own!
